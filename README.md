# zaruhev-dotfiles
Dotfiles for my Arch system. Mostly vanity stuff

# Installation
With the exception of `add-to-bashrc` and this README, you can virtually copy
the contents of this repository into your home directory.
> Note: If your `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` variable is not unset nor ~/.config, you 
probably shouldn't do this.

Assuming `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is unset or `~/.config`:
1. Copy contents of `./.config` into `~/.config`
2. Copy commands from `add-to-bashrc` into `~/.bashrc`
3. Make sure configured programs are installed. If they aren't,
it probablly won't cause any issues, but the dotfiles are useless
otherwise.
